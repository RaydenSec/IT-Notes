- [Dns](##dns)
- [Flushing DNS](##flushing-dns)
- [Python CLI Error](##python-cli-error)

## slow Internet
If a lot of customers are complaining about slow internet, you might need to increase bandwidth (Dos attack can also cause this)

## Dns
If can ping localhost, own IP, Router on network and IP of website on the internet, but user canâ€™t access webpages on the internet, means they have incorrect Dns address assigned -> if you type in youtube.com, w/out DNs, it does not know what youtube.com is

## Flush DNS
ipconfig /flushdns

## Python CLI Error
Windows: Installed Python3 from official website, but when running `Python3` in CLI, redirected to Microsoft Store page to download Python. 
Reason: Need to run Python3 where the software is located, not just anywhere in other directories. 
Solution: Find where Python3 is located (`C:\Users\{User}\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312`), copy the path. Then goto properties for `This PC`, in `Advanced system settings`, click on `Environment Variables`. Find `path` variable and `edit`, and create `New` path. Paste in path to directory where Python is. Can check if it's installed and accessible anywhere in CLI w/ `python3 --version`
Essentially executing program using `C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312` in CLI like any other executable
- Or try running `py` instead (apparently `python3` runs `C:\\Python{version num\\python.exe` and `C:\\Users\{User}\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python{version num}`
- Or maybe Windows Antivirus is blocking, so can create an exception
