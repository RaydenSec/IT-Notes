- [Windows Installation](##windows-installation)
- [slow Internet](##slow-internet)
- [Dns](##dns)

## slow Internet
If a lot of customers are complaining about slow internet, you might need to increase bandwidth (Dos attack can also cause this)

## Dns
If can ping localhost, own IP, Router on network and IP of website on the internet, but user canâ€™t access webpages on the internet, means they have incorrect Dns address assigned -> if you type in youtube.com, w/out DNs, it does not know what youtube.com is
