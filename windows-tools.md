## Task scheduler
Can be run w/ `taskschd.mc`
-	Tell Windows to do something at specified time (run backup script every night at certain time, or launch specific program at specific time)
-	A lot of the times when you install an application, if it has inbuilt updater, itâ€™ll automatically come into windows task schedular as a task (e.g. Norton auto updater in image below)
